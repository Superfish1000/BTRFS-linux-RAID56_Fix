# Open questions that need a decision

Things found while working on the RAID5/6 integrity series that are **not**
safe to fix autonomously, because the code is not simply wrong -- there is a
trade-off, a design choice, or a user-visible change involved. Each entry says
what was found, what the choice is, and what it would cost.

Bugs with an unambiguous correct fix are not listed here; those are fixed and
committed directly.

---

## 1. Crash + device loss is still unrecoverable

**What.** The write-intent log records stripe *addresses*, not data. Recovery
recomputes parity from the sectors on disk, which works because after a crash
the data is intact and only parity is stale. If a device dies before recovery
runs, there is no longer enough data to recompute, and the stripe is lost.

**The choice.** Closing it means journalling content, as Linux MD's RAID5
journal does. Measured against the eight-disk aging run: the log currently
writes 234K sectors; journalling the data and parity of every sub-stripe write
would write 1,476K. **Write amplification goes from 16% of RMW traffic to
100%.** MD makes its journal optional for exactly this reason.

**Options.** (a) Leave as is and document the limit. (b) Add optional
journalling behind a mount option or feature flag. (c) Journal only parity,
which is cheaper but does not close the gap on its own.

---

## 2. BTRFS_STRIPE_LEN is a compile-time constant

**What.** Stranded free space under an immutable-stripe rule is dominated by
the 64 KiB stripe unit, not by the rule. Re-gridding the same aged filesystems:

| | 64 KiB | 16 KiB | 8 KiB | 4 KiB |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RAID5 8-disk, nr_data=7 | 46.1% | 18.7% | 11.2% | 6.4% |
| RAID5 4-disk @92% full | 47.6% | 16.7% | 9.3% | 5.2% |

The on-disk format already carries `stripe_len` as a per-chunk `__le64` and
mkfs writes it, but `BTRFS_STRIPE_LEN` is `#define SZ_64K` in `volumes.h`, the
kernel never reads the field back, and `tree-checker.c` enforces the constant.

**The choice.** Making it variable is a substantial kernel change and costs the
property that a small read touches a single disk, plus many more rbios per
byte written. Worth it only if the immutable-stripe family is being pursued.

**Cheap next step if wanted.** Rebuild the UML kernel with a smaller
`BTRFS_STRIPE_LEN` and re-run the aging workload, to check the modelled numbers
against a filesystem that actually ran at that granule.

---

## 3. Stripe alignment is silently dropped on the bitmap path (pre-existing)

**What.** `bg->full_stripe_len` is cached at `block-group.c:2421` and passed as
an alignment into `find_free_space()` (`free-space-cache.c:3104`). On the
extent path it is honoured. On the **bitmap** path it is not:
`search_bitmap()` takes no alignment argument, and `find_free_space()` uses the
aligned offset only as a search start, returning whatever
`*offset = i * unit + bitmap_info->offset` finds
(`free-space-cache.c:2079-2087`).

So once a block group's free space has degraded into bitmaps -- which is what
happens as a filesystem ages, exactly when it matters -- stripe-aligned
allocation stops happening, with no indication.

Separately, alignment is applied only `if (*bytes >= align)`
(`free-space-cache.c:2056`), so it never applies to requests smaller than a
full stripe. That one looks deliberate: aligning a 4 KiB request to 448 KiB
would waste the difference.

**Why this is not fixed here.** It is upstream code, not part of this series;
the effect is on performance (more read-modify-writes) rather than correctness;
and honouring alignment inside bitmaps changes allocation behaviour for every
profile, not just RAID5/6.

**The choice.** Leave it; or teach `search_bitmap()` an alignment and measure
the effect on the full-stripe versus sub-stripe ratio, which
`/sys/fs/btrfs/<uuid>/raid56_write_profile` now reports directly.

---

## 5. The model reports acknowledged loss at three or more data stripes

**What.** `sweep.sh` originally never passed `--data`, so every configuration
behind the "fixed accounting is clean everywhere" claim ran at the default of
two data stripes -- a 3-disk RAID5 and a 4-disk RAID6. The arrays actually
measured in this series have `nr_data` 3 and 7. At three or more the model
reports acknowledged loss, for both RAID5 and RAID6:

```
history: ('rmw', (1,2), ('1','2','p0')) ; ('rmw', (2,), ('2',)) ; ('rmw', (1,), ('p0',))
final:   disk=[0,102,2]  parity=[(0,1,101)]  committed=[0,102,101]
```

The second write puts 101 into stripe 2; its data write fails and only the
parity carries the value. One fault against one parity, so the write is
accepted. The third write touches stripe 1 and loses its parity write. Again
one fault, again accepted -- but parity was the only copy of stripe 2, so that
stripe's committed content now exists nowhere.

`nr_data = 2` is clean at depth 5, so this is a width property and not a
search-depth artifact.

**Why it is not obviously a defect.** Each RMW counts faults within its own
rbio, which is what `rbio_max_errors()` is for; neither write individually
exceeds the profile. The stripe is left recorded as sticky in the write-intent
log precisely because it completed with a device error, so the next mount
scrubs it and restores redundancy. The exposure is the window between the
failed write and that scrub.

**The choice.** Whether an RMW should de-rate its fault tolerance when the
stripe it is about to write is already one fault down -- at the cost of failing
writes that today succeed. Or whether this is inherent to a one-fault-tolerant
profile taking two faults, and belongs in the documented exposures instead.

### Both de-rate variants were built and measured

Written, run, and then backed out. `sweep.sh` runs both so the numbers stay
visible.

**Flat (`--flat-sticky-derate`).** `btrfs_wib_has_sticky()` before the writes,
then `rbio_max_errors(rbio) - degraded` after them. Implementable: it needs
only the log's sticky bit. It **does** close the wider-array loss at `--data 3`
and `--data 4`, for both parities.

It also breaks degraded arrays. The sticky bit does not say why it was set, and
a missing device sets one on every write it touches -- but that same fault is
already counted against the next write by the `missing_faults` rule, so
de-rating for it charges one lost equation twice. On a RAID5 with a device
gone that is the entire budget: the first write to a full stripe succeeds and
records it, and every write to that stripe afterwards returns EIO. A degraded
array goes read-only one stripe at a time.

Suppressing the de-rate while any device is missing fixes that particular case
and leaves the real cost: on a healthy array, a stripe that took one transient
write error refuses its next failing write until a scrub clears the record.
That is correct for integrity and is a loss of availability, which is the
trade-off this entry exists to have decided.

**Counted (`--counted-sticky-derate`).** Caps the budget by the stripe's true
remaining margin -- the parities still agreeing with the disk on every
non-stale sector, minus the sectors needing them. Strictly stronger, and *not*
implementable the same way: computing it needs every parity compared against
every sector on disk, which the write path does not have and cannot afford to
read. It is in the model to show what the extra strength would buy, not as a
candidate.

**The trap this walked into.** For a while the model's default policy was the
counted de-rate while the kernel had neither, so the sweep reported "wider
arrays clean" and this entry was deleted as resolved. Nothing in the kernel had
changed. The model's default is now the kernel's behaviour -- no de-rate -- and
a variant has to be asked for by name.

---

## 6. RAID6 Q cross-check: tested, did not reproduce

**The claim.** `recover_verify_q()` rejects a rebuild whenever the two parity
blocks disagree, and they legitimately disagree on stripes holding no committed
data -- so a degraded RAID6 array could not write into fresh space at all.

**Tested.** `uml/degraded_fresh.sh` boots an array degraded from the first
mount and writes into never-written space. On six devices with one omitted,
where the chunk is wide enough for sub-stripe writes to exist at all
(`sub_stripe_writes 23`), all 21 writes plus an in-place nodatacow overwrite
succeeded, with no Q-syndrome warning.

**Why not.** The premise does not hold on these images: unwritten space is
zeros, so P and Q are both zero and agree trivially. The check needs unwritten
space holding *garbage* -- a disk reused from something else -- before P and Q
disagree there.

**What is left.** A narrower question than the original: whether a reused disk
with non-zero content in never-written regions can make a degraded RAID6 refuse
sub-stripe writes. Reproducing it means seeding the images with garbage before
mkfs, which the rig does not currently do. Recorded rather than closed, because
"did not reproduce under the conditions I tried" is not "cannot happen".

Note the first attempt at this test passed while proving nothing: on four
devices with one omitted the chunk is three wide, `nr_data` is 1, and no write
can be sub-stripe -- `sub_stripe_writes` stayed 0. The write profile counters
are what caught that.

---

## 4. Two residual exposures the model checker still reports

Both reproduce in `tools/testing/btrfs/raid56_redundancy_model.py`; the sweep
runs them under their own heading and `regress.sh` diffs the result against
`tools/testing/btrfs/uml/residual-exposures.txt`. Both are documented rather
than fixed, because both need a semantic decision about what a failed sector
write should mean.

**`--in-place --strict`:** a `nodatacow` or prealloc write overwrites
referenced sectors by definition, so committed data is at risk even when the
write covers the full stripe. The log records these (`RBIO_INPLACE_BIT`) so
parity is recoverable, but the overwritten data itself is not. It only shows
under `--strict`, which is the mode that asks whether a *failed* write may
destroy committed data; outside it a failed write is allowed to, so an
`--in-place` row without `--strict` cannot violate and checking one proves
nothing. Reported at both parities and both depths.

**`--nodatasum`:** without checksums a stale sector cannot be told from a good
one, so a reconstruction from a parity that a failed write left behind is
returned as if it were correct. Reported at both parities:

```
history: ('rmw', (1,), ('1', 'p0')) ; ('rmw', (1,), ('p0',))
final:   disk=[0, 101] parity=[(0, 1)] committed=[0, 101]
         read of stripe 1 after losing device 1 returns 1, not 101
```

The second write lands 101 on the data device and loses only its parity write:
one fault, inside the profile's tolerance, so it is accepted. The parity is now
stale -- it still describes the pre-write value. Lose the data device and the
reconstruction from that parity returns 1. With checksums that is a detected
mismatch and the read fails; without them it is returned as data, and the
acknowledged write is silently undone.

**The choice.** Whether a write that spends redundancy should be refused
outright on a `nodatasum` filesystem -- which means any transient write error
on any one device fails the whole write, on the profile that is supposed to
absorb it -- or continue to be accepted with the exposure documented. The
write-intent log narrows the window (the stripe is recorded and the next scrub
repairs it) but does not close it: devices that die before that scrub runs are
enough.

---

---

## 7. Persisting the stale record costs log capacity

**What.** The scrub fix works off the log's `stale` record -- which data column
holds content a failed write left on disk. That record lives only in memory, so
across a mount only `sticky` survives, and `sticky` says a write failed without
saying which side of the stripe is wrong. Until it is persisted, the scrub
protection is per-mount only: the first `btrfs scrub` after a reboot can still
destroy the parity copy.

**The change.** `struct btrfs_wib_disk_entry` grows from 24 to 32 bytes: one
more `__le64` carrying `stale`, with parity staleness packed into the same
bitmap (the block at the full stripe's start encodes parity 0, the next block
parity 1 -- `nr_data` is at least 2, so those bits always belong to the stripe
they describe).

**The cost, measured -- and it is not the one this entry originally named.**
The obvious reading is "less dirty address space tracked", which sounds
harmless. The real cost is on the write path.

The on-disk block is not the in-flight set: `btrfs_wib_build_block()` unions
the live table with `wib->last`, so the block is the running union of every
region marked since the last drop, and drops happen only at transaction commit
(30s by default). When that union no longer fits, `wib_write_block_locked()`
returns `-ENOSPC` and `wib_commit_locked()` falls back to
`wib_flush_and_drop_locked()` -- a `REQ_PREFLUSH` to **every writable device**
plus a FUA block write, up to three times, **with the marking RMW blocked on
it** inside `btrfs_wib_mark()`.

That overflow fires once per `BTRFS_WIB_MAX_ENTRIES` distinct new 4MiB
regions. So the entry size sets the rate of inline device-wide cache flushes
on the write path:

| entry | entries/slot | tracked | flush rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| 24B, today (no stale) | 165 | 660 MiB | 1.00x |
| 32B (+stale) | 124 | 496 MiB | 1.33x |
| 40B (+stale, +stale_par) -- **what is implemented** | 99 | 396 MiB | 1.67x |

The in-memory table is a fixed array sized by the same constant
(`entries[BTRFS_WIB_MAX_ENTRIES]`), so it cannot be tuned independently. More
slots do not help: the two slots are alternating generations of the same
block. A bigger slot has 512KiB of physical headroom but is blocked by
single-page buffers and single-page bios.

**The remedy, designed but not built.** `stale` is zero almost always -- the
design says so itself, which is why `btrfs_wib_stale()` has a lock-free
`nr_stale == 0` fast path. So encode it out of the common case: keep the
24-byte entry, and append a sparse extension array of `{__le32 index, __le64
stale, __le64 stale_par}` (20 bytes) after it, with the count in the header.
With no stale records that is 165 entries and **no regression at all**; with
every entry stale it is 90, slightly worse than the flat 99, which is the
right way round -- the pathological case pays and the normal case does not.

**The choice.** Ship the flat 40-byte entry and its 1.67x flush rate; or build
the sparse encoding first; or leave the record per-mount and accept that the
protection resets at every boot -- which the model prices at 1488 of 8386
RAID5 states destroyed, i.e. the whole fix.

---

## 8. Scrub: skip the stripe, or rebuild it

**What.** `scrub_raid56_parity_stripe()` now declines to regenerate the parity
when the log records a data column of that full stripe stale. Sound, and small:
one early return. The state-machine model scores it 0 on every axis.

But it does not repair. The stronger policy -- rebuild the stale column *from*
the parity, write it back, then regenerate -- is also clean and leaves far
fewer stripes without redundancy: 259 against 973 on RAID5, 2718 against 9705
on RAID6.

**Why it is not done.** It needs a write-back path scrub does not have at that
point. The machinery exists: marking the stale sectors in the scrub stripe's
error bitmap after `scrub_verify_one_stripe()` would make the existing repair
loop reconstruct them through mirror 2 and write them back. It has to go in
`scrub_stripe_read_repair_worker()`, which only knows its own data column, so
it needs a chunk-map lookup to find the full stripe.

**The choice.** Ship the skip and leave 3.5x more stripes unrepaired, or build
the write-back path.

---

## 9. Debug knobs that turn protections off

**What.** Two `CONFIG_BTRFS_DEBUG`-only module parameters were added:

- `raid56_allow_nodatacow` -- turns off both the `chattr +C` refusal and the
  forced copy-on-write fallback.
- `raid56_stale_read_legacy` -- restores the read-path behaviour that ignores
  the rebuild budget.

Both exist because the reproductions cannot otherwise reach the states they
demonstrate: refusing `chattr +C` removes the only way to *build* the
nodatacow-on-RAID5/6 state, and a negative control needs the defect back.

**The choice.** Whether shipping switches that restore known defects, even in
debug builds, is acceptable. The alternative is a second kernel build per
control, which is what made negative controls expensive enough to skip -- and
skipping them is how five claims got made and withdrawn in this series.

---

## 10. `chattr +C` on RAID5/6 now fails

**What.** `check_fsflags_compatible()` returns `-EPERM` for `FS_NOCOW_FL` when
the RAID56 incompat bit is set, matching the existing zoned precedent. Anything
that scripts `chattr +C` on a RAID5/6 array -- VM image directories, database
data directories, `systemd-nspawn` machine trees -- starts failing.

**The choice.** Refusal, which is what the zoned case does and what the user
asked for over silently substituting different behaviour; or a warning plus the
forced copy-on-write, which keeps those scripts working while quietly changing
what they get.

---

## 11. A crash on a failing device leaves files reading back complete and wrong

**What.** The `flakey` scenario -- background writers, one device failing
every write, then a crash, then probes with one device omitted -- reports two
classes of damaged file, and `regress.sh` now separates them:

- **read failed** (4 to 19 per run): the read errors and `md5sum` prints
  nothing. This is item 1 of this document: the log records stripe addresses,
  not content, so a stripe whose data is gone cannot be rebuilt, and the
  kernel says so.
- **wrong data** (0 to 5 per run): the read SUCCEEDS and returns a file of
  exactly the right length whose content differs from what was fsync'd. No
  checksum error is raised.

**Why the second one should not be possible.** The writers use plain `dd`, so
the data is checksummed. Metadata is `raid1`, so the checksum tree is not
touched by the RAID5 degradation. Each file is created exactly once, so there
is no earlier version to roll back to. On those three facts a wrong
reconstruction has to fail its checksum and the read has to error. It does
not, so one of the three is false, and which one is not yet established.

Every mismatching file measured is at exactly its expected size --
45056/45056, 57344/57344, 28672/28672, 53248/53248, 61440/61440, 32768/32768
-- so it is not truncation, which was the obvious explanation and is dead.

**Not this series.** It reproduces with `noraid56_write_intent`, and more
often, not less:

| | wrong data | read failed |
|---|---|---|
| log on | 1, 1, 2, 3, 3 | 0, 5, 7, 9, 11 |
| log off | 0, 3, 5, 7 | 4, 6, 11, 19 |

An earlier reading called the log implicated, on the strength of one run per
arm that happened to give 3 against 0. Repeating the log-off arm gave 3, 5 and
7, so that was noise -- and the fuller picture points the other way. It also
predates every commit in this night's work.

**Reproduce.** `BTRFS_TEST_DIR=... tools/testing/btrfs/uml/dmfail34.sh
<kernel> <tag> flakey raid5:raid1 rw 4 2`

**The choice.** Whether to chase this now -- it is an upstream-shaped bug in
the crash path rather than part of the write-hole work -- or record it and
carry on with the series.

---

## 12. A recorded stripe never retires, and persisting @stale inherits that

**What.** Every stripe the log records because of a device error is kept
recorded **forever**, and its parity is never regenerated by recovery. Traced
in the code, not inferred:

- `stale` is a strict subset of `sticky`, so
  `trusted = !wib_pending_has_error(wib, start, len)` is false for any stripe
  with an error record (`raid56-wib.c`, in `btrfs_wib_recover()`).
- `wib_recover_one()` with `trusted == false` ends
  `if (!trusted) { st->kept++; return 1; }` -- it returns 1 unconditionally.
- `return 1` is the re-arm branch, so `btrfs_wib_add_sticky()` puts the record
  straight back. The drop path is never taken.
- `btrfs_wib_recover_after_replay()` passes `trusted = false` literally, so its
  `if (ret == 0) btrfs_wib_clear_sticky()` is dead code for any stripe whose
  chunk still exists. The only reachable clears there are "the chunk is gone"
  and one corner case.
- `scrub_raid56_parity_stripe()` reads the record and returns without touching
  the log, so a user scrub does not retire it either.

The only live clearer is `rmw_update_stale_data()`, and it is triple-gated: the
RMW must be *logged* (sub-stripe, or in-place -- and in-place on RAID5/6 is now
refused), must have supplied data for that column, and must have taken no error
on it. A full-stripe CoW write over the same range sets `logged = false` and
clears nothing.

**This is pre-existing, not caused by persisting the record.** `sticky` already
behaved this way. What persistence changes is that the *scrub* skip becomes
permanent too: before, `stale` died at unmount and the next scrub would
regenerate the parity -- destroying data, which is why it was fixed, but at
least the record retired.

**Why it matters now.** The combination shipped is "persist the record" plus
"scrub skips a stale stripe". Together they mean a stripe that takes one
transient write error keeps its degraded redundancy until something happens to
sub-stripe-write that exact column again. On cold data, that is never.

**The fix is the one already costed in item 8.** Skipping is what makes the
record permanent; **rebuilding retires it**. If the scrub reconstructs the
stale column from the parity, writes it back and then regenerates the parity,
the data on disk is correct again and the record can be cleared. So item 8 is
not an optimisation -- it is what makes persistence terminate.
`btrfs_scrub_raid56_full_stripe()` already documents itself as "repair the bad
ones from the parity and write them back"; that path simply never fires for a
sector with no checksum, because nothing marks it bad. The stale record is
exactly the thing that could.

**The choice.** Build the rebuild path and let persistence terminate; or ship
as is and accept that an error-recorded stripe stays without regenerated
parity indefinitely; or make the scrub retire the record after skipping it,
which returns to destroying data and is not a real option.

**Smaller findings from the same trace, both fixed:**

- `wib_dropped_bits()` measured change as `bitmap | error`, and `stale` is a
  subset of `error`, so a stale bit clearing on its own looked like no change.
  A "no longer stale" record could become durable before the write that made it
  non-stale. It now counts as a dropped bit, which forces the flush first.
- `struct btrfs_wib_entry` still documented `@stale` as "Not persisted", in the
  exact place a reviewer looks to answer this question.

**Not fixed, recorded:** `wib_readd_stale()` silently drops the record when
`btrfs_wib_add_sticky()` could not find room; a stale verdict survives runtime
chunk removal until the next mount and could in principle be inherited by a new
block group at the same logical address; and on a read-only mount
`wib_readd_stale()` never runs, so the record is invisible for that mount --
which is no worse than upstream, but is not protection either.

---

## 13. The stale record mostly fires for data that has a checksum

**What.** `rmw_update_stale_data()` marks a column stale for **any** logged
sub-stripe write that took an error. There is no nodatacow condition on it.
And since `chattr +C` is now refused on RAID5/6 (item 10), the producers left
in a non-debug kernel are mostly sub-stripe CoW data writes and **metadata
tree blocks on a RAID5/6 metadata profile** -- exactly the content that *does*
carry a checksum.

The record's entire justification is "for data with no checksum this is the
only thing that knows". For checksummed content scrub already knows: it
verifies the sector, finds the mismatch, rebuilds it from the parity and
writes it back. The record adds nothing there -- and the scrub skip built on
it actively costs, because it declines to regenerate a parity scrub was
perfectly capable of fixing.

Unchecksummed data has not disappeared: an inode marked `+C` before the
refusal existed still implies NODATASUM, and its writes are unchecksummed even
once forced to copy-on-write. So the record still has real work to do. It just
is not the common case any more.

**The refinement.** Let the record gate the scrub only for sectors that have
no checksum. Scrub knows which those are -- it already carries the csum
bitmap per data stripe. Where everything in the stripe is checksummed, scrub's
own verification is authoritative and it should proceed normally.

That removes most of item 12's permanence in production, because the stripes
it would otherwise pin open are the checksummed ones scrub can finish itself.

**The choice.** Build the csum gate; or build the rebuild path of item 8,
which subsumes it; or leave the skip blunt and accept that a metadata stripe
that took one transient write error never has its parity regenerated again.

---

## 14. Choosing the on-disk layout per block, and what it fixed

Recorded because the first implementation had all three of these and none was
found by a test.

Persisting `stale` widened the on-disk entry from 24 to 40 bytes, and the
first version stamped the new format on **every** block. That did three things
nobody asked for:

- **Downgrade broke for every filesystem.** A kernel predating the format
  rejects any block with a nonzero flags field -- correctly, since it cannot
  know the stride -- and a rejected log means the stripes it covers are never
  recovered. Stamping the wide format unconditionally imposed that on
  filesystems that had never had a stale record in their lives.
- **The write path paid the flush cost unconditionally**, 99 entries against
  165 before the on-disk union overflows and `btrfs_wib_mark()` waits on a
  `REQ_PREFLUSH` to every device (item 7).
- **The first mount after upgrading could drop records.** A format-1 block may
  legally carry 165 entries; the new kernel accepts and loads all of them, and
  then cannot fit them into a 99-entry wide block.

All three are gone now: `btrfs_wib_build_block()` picks the narrowest layout
that can say what the block has to say, and nothing stale -- the overwhelmingly
common case, and the reason `btrfs_wib_stale()` has a lock-free fast path --
means the narrow one.

Two things that had to follow. The in-memory table is now sized by its own
constant (`BTRFS_WIB_NR_ENTRIES`), because how many regions a mount can track
has nothing to do with how wide an entry is on disk, and letting the narrow
format set it silently shrank live capacity from 165 to 99. And the helpers
that walk the kernel's own last block -- `wib_dropped_bits()`,
`btrfs_wib_block_drops()`, `wib_readd_dropped()` -- used to be stride-safe by
construction and are not any more, since the same kernel now writes both
layouts; they all decode rather than index.

## 15. Protecting an ambiguous stripe: what two adversarial rounds established

Design question from the user: during a scrub, when a stripe is found AMBIGUOUS,
clone its bytes to an external recovery drive plugged in for the purpose, and
prevent writes to that stripe meanwhile, so a post-scrub utility can test
rebuild configurations and recover the file.

Two workflows ran. **Both hit a spend limit and neither produced a synthesis**,
so what follows is the completed subset, not a finished analysis.

### What actually completed

| angle | lenses run | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| fence for the clone window only | 4/4 | 4 fatal |
| fence for the duration of the scrub | 4/4 | 4 fatal |
| fence until the record is retired | 4/4 | 4 fatal |
| make the RMW itself safe (no fence) | 1/4 | incomplete |
| freeze the stripe's free space | 4/4 | 4 fatal |
| opt-in forensic fence | **0/4** | **NOT REVIEWED** |
| evacuate the neighbours | **0/4** | **NOT REVIEWED** |
| stream during scrub, protect nothing | **0/4** | **NOT REVIEWED** |

The two angles scored `0 fatal` are **not** survivors. Every one of their
reviewers failed to run. Do not read those as passing.

### The one claim that was tested and refuted

The hypothesis was that protection could be free: since RAID5/6 forces CoW
(`can_nocow_file_extent()`, inode.c ~1913, gating both BTRFS_ORDERED_NOCOW and
BTRFS_ORDERED_PREALLOC), a committed extent is never overwritten in place, so
the only way a committed stripe's content changes is a new allocation into its
free space -- and removing that free space from the allocator would freeze the
stripe with no fence, no refused write and no bystander held hostage.

**Refuted.** `btrfs_repair_io_failure()` (bio.c:997) writes into a committed
stripe with no allocation, no ordered extent, and without entering raid56.c at
all. `btrfs_map_repair_block()` (volumes.c:9053) collapses the RAID56 write to
a single device write -- its own comment says "Not update any other mirrors nor
go through RMW path" -- so it writes one data column and does not recompute the
parity. Its only guard is `sb_rdonly()`.

So a freeze-only design has a hole, and would need a hold predicate in the
repair path as a companion. That companion costs no availability: it only
suppresses an opportunistic repair.

### What was claimed but is NOT established

The proposal's own weakest-point section argued this path is the *most likely*
destroyer of an ambiguous stripe's evidence, and that because it writes a
column without recomputing parity it turns "data stale, truth survives in the
parity" into truth nowhere -- with the sharp edge that the helper's own clone
pass is the read that triggers it.

Worked through on paper, that does not follow. The write-back at bio.c:281 is
reached only when the reconstruction PASSED its checksum (the guard at
bio.c:274 declines only `BTRFS_CSUM_NONE`). In a stripe with a genuinely stale
data column, reconstructing a checksummed neighbour consumes that stale column
and yields a value that fails its checksum, so the repair never fires. The
harmful case could not be reproduced by reasoning. **Needs a real test before
anyone acts on it**, in either direction: if it is reachable it is serious, and
if it is not, the freeze needs a smaller companion than claimed.

### Other findings worth keeping (self-reported, spot-checked, not all verified)

- A fence keyed on `full_stripe_logical` is satisfied vacuously by
  `btrfs_remove_chunk()` (volumes.c:3518), which deletes the mapping rather
  than writing -- reached from balance, the unused-bg cleaner (block-group.c:1818)
  and bg reclaim (block-group.c:2049). Verified separately this session that
  nothing in block-group.c calls any `btrfs_wib_*`; that is now fixed by
  `btrfs_wib_forget_range()`, but a *fence* would have the same blind spot.
- One refused write fails an entire ordered extent, up to BTRFS_MAX_EXTENT_SIZE
  (128MiB, fs.h:74), across potentially many inodes -- so a fence's blast radius
  is not bounded by the fenced stripe's size.
- `mark_stale_sectors()`'s budget bail fires on transients (a flapping cable, a
  controller reset), so any "fence until retired" design quarantines stripes
  that were never permanently ambiguous, with no automatic release.
- Automatic reclaim selects on `bg->used` alone (`should_reclaim_block_group()`,
  block-group.c:1919; `do_reclaim_sweep()`, space-info.c:2156), so freezing free
  space does not stop the reclaim worker handing the whole chunk to
  `btrfs_relocate_chunk()` with no user action.
- The evacuate design depends on REMAP_TREE, which is in
  `BTRFS_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_SUPP` only under CONFIG_BTRFS_EXPERIMENTAL
  (fs.h:334-347) and is mkfs-time. It cannot help a filesystem that develops an
  ambiguous stripe tomorrow.
- There is no REQ_FAILFAST anywhere in fs/btrfs and no btrfs-level IO timeout.
  An AMBIGUOUS stripe is by definition one with a column on a member whose last
  write did not land, so any design that reads it holds its lock across exactly
  the reads that cost tens of seconds.

### The decision this leaves

Not "which design", but whether to re-run the missing adversarial passes at all.
