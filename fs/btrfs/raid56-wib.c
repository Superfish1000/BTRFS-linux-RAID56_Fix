 * RAID56 write-intent log.
 *
 * [THE PROBLEM]
 *
 * A sub-stripe write on a RAID5/6 block group is a read-modify-write of the
 * full stripe: the data sectors of the higher layer bios and the recomputed
 * P/Q sectors are written as independent bios to independent devices.  If
 * the machine crashes after some of those writes reached their device and
 * others did not, the vertical stripes touched by the RMW are inconsistent:
 * P/Q no longer match the data.
 *
 * The newly written data sectors are unreferenced (btrfs is copy-on-write,
 * the transaction referencing them never committed), but the other sectors
 * of the same vertical stripes belong to committed extents.  They are still
 * readable, but they lost their redundancy: if the device holding them
 * fails, rebuilding them from the stale parity yields garbage.  This is the
 * classic RAID5/6 write hole.  In-place writes (nodatacow, preallocated
 * extents) are affected even when they cover the full stripe, because the
 * sectors being overwritten are themselves referenced.
 *
 * [THE FIX]
 *
 * Before the writes of such a RMW are submitted, the full stripe is recorded
 * in a small log that lives at a fixed location on every writable device,
 * and the log write is made durable (FUA).  After all writes of the RMW have
 * completed the stripe is removed from the in-memory set; the on-disk log is
 * rewritten lazily: the log writes issued for new RMWs only ever add to the
 * on-disk block, and a stripe is dropped from it only by the transaction
 * (or log) commit, after the commit's device barriers confirmed that every
 * device flushed its cache, so that the stripe's data and parity writes are
 * on stable media before the log stops mentioning the stripe.
 *
 * On mount, the newest valid log block of every present device is read,
 * the union taken, and every listed full stripe is scrubbed
 * (btrfs_scrub_raid56_full_stripe()): every sector holding an extent is
 * verified by checksum, bad ones are rebuilt from the existing parity, and
 * P/Q are regenerated.  Only afterwards is the filesystem written to.
 *
 * [RECORD KINDS]
 *
 * A record is either clean (the stripe had a write in flight on a fully
 * working array) or an error record (a write to the stripe failed on some
 * device, the record of a dropped stripe may not have reached a device with
 * its data flushed, or a previous recovery could not finish).
 *
 * For a clean record every present device holds what was last written to
 * it, so after the extents visible in the commit roots have been verified,
 * the parity of every vertical stripe is recomputed from the data as it is
 * on disk.  This also covers extents that are only referenced from the tree
 * log (fsync'ed data and the log tree blocks themselves), which the extent
 * tree does not know yet at that point.
 *
 * For an error record a device may hold stale sectors, so only sectors that
 * can be verified are trusted: the parity is recomputed from verified data
 * only, and if a sector cannot be repaired the parity is left alone.  The
 * record stays until a later pass can verify everything: after the tree log
 * has been replayed (so that its extents are visible), or at a later mount
 * once a missing device is back or replaced.
 *
 * [INVARIANT]
 *
 * At any instant, every full stripe that has a write whose data or parity
 * may not yet be on stable media is listed in the newest valid on-disk log
 * block of enough devices to survive the RAID's tolerated number of device
 * failures.  Proof sketch:
 *
 *  - A RMW proceeds to its writes only after a commit whose snapshot
 *    contained its stripe completed on enough devices (btrfs_wib_mark()).
 *  - A stripe is dropped from a snapshot only after btrfs_wib_done(), i.e.
 *    after all its writes completed at the device level, and only after a
 *    flush of every device that every device confirmed, which pushes those
 *    completed writes to stable media before the new log block lands.  If
 *    a device did not confirm the flush, the stripes are kept in the block
 *    as error records instead (that device may hold stale sectors).  All
 *    other blocks are supersets of the previous one, so a device that
 *    misses a write keeps a block that lists everything it may hold
 *    unflushed.
 *  - Each device alternates between its two slots and only advances after
 *    a successful write, so the block being overwritten on a device is
 *    never its newest valid one; a torn write invalidates at most the newest
 *    block, and the previous block is a superset with respect to the
 *    stripes that could still be in flight (see the points above).
 *  - Recovery uses the union of all devices' newest valid blocks.  Stale
 *    blocks (from an old device that re-joined, or a device that missed
 *    commits) can only add stripes to scrub, which is harmless: scrubbing
 *    a consistent stripe is a no-op.
 *
 * [LIMITS]
 *
 * If the array is degraded (a device missing) when the crash happens, a
 * vertical stripe whose missing sector was committed data and whose parity
 * was in the middle of an update cannot be reconstructed with certainty.
 * Recovery then relies on data checksums: the rebuild is verified and
 * refused when it does not match, so the loss is detected, not silent
 * (except for nodatasum data, which has no checksum to verify against).
 * Closing that case requires journaling the data itself, which this log
 * does not do.
