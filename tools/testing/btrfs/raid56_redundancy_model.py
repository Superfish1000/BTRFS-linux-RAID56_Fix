"""
Exhaustive model of the RAID5/6 redundancy accounting of a single vertical
stripe, checking that btrfs never acknowledges a write that has destroyed
data it is responsible for.

The model tracks VALUES, not just fault counts, so it detects silent
corruption (a read returning something other than what was committed) and not
only "too many faults".

  State
    disk[i]      content of data stripe i on its device, or STALE
    parity       the value the P sector was computed from (RAID6: P and Q)
    committed[i] what the filesystem believes stripe i holds (None = free
                 space, not referenced by any committed transaction)
    missing[d]   the device of stripe d is absent
    cache        content the stripe cache holds for the full stripe, and
                 whether the cache is allowed to seed the next RMW

  Operations
    rmw(S, values, failures)  a read-modify-write of the data stripes in S
    full(values, failures)    a full stripe write
    lose(d)                   device d disappears after the fact

  Invariant (checked after every step and after every subsequent device loss
  within the profile's tolerance)
    every stripe i with committed[i] != None reads back as committed[i],
    where a read uses the device if present, else reconstructs from the
    parity and the other present sectors.

  Policies (what the kernel does after the writes complete)
    upstream   count only sectors with an error bit; tolerate
               bioc->max_errors, which a running device replace inflates by
               one, and a failed write to the replace target sets the
               source stripe's error bit
    fixed      count a missing device as a fault of every vertical stripe,
               tolerate real_stripes - nr_data, and never attribute a
               replace-target failure to the source

  Cache policies
    keep       a failed RMW leaves its pages in the stripe cache (upstream)
    drop       a failed RMW invalidates them (fixed)

  Results with the fixed accounting (see sweep.sh)

    RAID5 and RAID6, copy-on-write writes, on a healthy array, on a degraded
    one and while a device replace runs: no silent corruption and no
    acknowledged loss, at every depth explored.  Reverting any one of the
    three accounting rules reintroduces a violation.

    Two exposures remain, both from the same root cause: a write failure that
    stays within the profile's tolerance is acknowledged, and the sector it
    did not reach stays stale on its device while the correct content lives
    only in the parity.  Nothing tracks that latent fault afterwards.

      --nodatasum  a read of that sector returns the stale content, because
                   there is no checksum to notice and send the read to the
                   parity.  The acknowledged write is silently undone.
      --in-place   the latent fault plus a later parity write failure is two
                   faults in one vertical stripe, and the committed content
                   is gone.  Detected for checksummed data.

    rmw_retry_failed_sectors() removes the transient case; a device that
    keeps failing still leaves the window open until the next scrub.
