# Does the write-intent log's mount-time recovery DESTROY nodatacow data that
# was still recoverable before it ran?
#
#   nocow_stale.sh <kernel> [ndev] [fail-device]
#
# A nodatacow sector carries no checksum, so scrub_verify_one_sector() trusts
# whatever is on the disk and scrub_raid56_parity_stripe() recomputes the
# parity from it.  When a failed write left that sector stale, the parity held
# the only copy of the acknowledged content -- and recovery replaces it with a
# parity computed from the stale sector.
#
# The experiment reads the same blocks three times, always with the device
# holding the stale sectors OMITTED so the read must come from the parity:
#
#   before  after the failed writes, read-only so recovery does not run
#   after   once a read-write mount has run recovery
#
# before=0 and after>0 is the defect: data that the parity could still supply
# is gone once recovery has been.  before>0 means the premise is wrong and the
# parity never held it.
