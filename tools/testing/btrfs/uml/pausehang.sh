# Does the write-intent log's recovery wedge against the scrub pause protocol?

#   pausehang.sh <kernel> [ndev] [fail-device] [delay-ms]
#
# The recovery is kept out of fs_info->scrubs_running on purpose, but the
# scrub code it calls increments fs_info->scrubs_paused.  btrfs_scrub_pause()
# waits for those two to be EQUAL and scrub_pause_off() waits for pause_req to
# reach zero, so a commit arriving while the recovery is inside the protocol
# leaves each waiting on the other.
#
# REMOUNT_RW_DONE  the remount finished: no wedge
# REMOUNT_RW_STUCK the remount never returned
