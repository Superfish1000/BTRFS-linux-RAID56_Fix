# Does a plain "btrfs scrub" AFTER A REBOOT still destroy nodatacow data that
# the parity could supply?
#
#   nocow_persist.sh <kernel> [ndev] [fail-device]
#
# The write-intent log records which data blocks a failed write left stale.
# That record used to live only in memory, so it did not survive an unmount --
# and a scrub run after the next mount had nothing to consult, trusted the
# stale sector for want of a checksum, and recomputed the parity from it,
# destroying the only copy of what was acknowledged.
#
# An exhaustive model of the same decision
# (tools/testing/btrfs/scrub_policy_model.py) prices that at 1488 of 8386
# RAID5 states and 6291 of 41791 RAID6 states destroyed -- which is upstream's
# own score, i.e. the scrub fix is worth nothing across a mount without the
# record.  This is the physical version of that claim.
#
# Three boots per arm:
#   prep    build the state with a device failing writes, then unmount CLEANLY
#   scrub   mount fresh, let recovery run, then run a plain user scrub
#   probe   mount ro,degraded with the failing device OMITTED, so every one of
#           those blocks must come from the parity, and count the bad ones
#
# Runs both arms.  The control sets raid56_stale_no_persist=1 during prep, so
# the log is written exactly as the format did before it carried the record.
# A clean result in the fixed arm means nothing unless the control fails.
